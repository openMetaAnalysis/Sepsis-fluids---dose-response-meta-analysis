Sepsis fluids and timing - dose-response meta-analysis
============================================
A living systematic review

(this meta-analysis is in the exploratory state; formal lit search has not been started)

Short url: http://openmetaanalysis.github.io/Sepsis-fluids_and_timing_-_dose-response_meta-analysis

**Clinical summary:** 
This meta-analysis suggests that the optimal dosing of fluids is:
* Give at least 30 ml/kg by hour three for the typical patient
* Avoid over 60 ml /kg within the first 24 hours. Optimal is about 40 ml/kg for the typical patient.
<!--
effectiveness of the clinical intervention *is* [moderate](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-15#section-15-5-3-1). [Standarized mean differences](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-15#section-15-3) betweeen intervention and control groups across outcomes range from x to y. 

Heterogeneity of results as measured by I<sup>2</sup> '[might not be important](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-10#section-10-10-2)' at x% for all analyses; however very wide confidence intervals reflect the small number of studies and subjects. 

Meta-regression of common modulators (year of publication, study size, event rate in the control groups) has not been done due to the small number of studies.
